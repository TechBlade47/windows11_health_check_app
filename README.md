# windows11_health_check_app
The windows 11 compatibility tool for windows 10 that microsoft removed from their website (at some point during the early stages of development i believe, its now back, in the latest version which I believe comes preinstalled in every w10 install) ,
extract all the files to a folder and run PCHealthCheck.exe , if it doesn't work properly please contact me on discord (@bladestech) and I will try my best to help you!

this is the original version of the health check app.

(This is not the latest version of the app I repeat! This is the very first/one of the first versions created).
